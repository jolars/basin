# TODO

Ordered by recommended sequence.

## Solvers and integrations

These priorities come from comparing Basin with the [SciPy optimization
catalog](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html). Favor
capabilities that help downstream integrations. Preserve Basin 1.x APIs and
behavior, the default WASM build, and honest backend support. Validate new
numerical work against analytic cases and reference implementations.

### Priority additions

- [x] **Implement SLSQP.** Add a dense, pure-Rust solver for smooth objectives
  with box bounds, nonlinear equalities, and nonlinear inequalities. Add
  compatible problem-side interfaces for nonlinear equalities and constraint
  Jacobians, with analytic derivatives and finite-difference adapters.
  Preserve the default WASM build and validate every supported backend
  against analytic cases and SciPy/NLopt reference results, including
  feasibility, stationarity, rank-deficient constraints, and failure
  handling.
- [x] **Make finite differences respect box bounds.** Add an opt-in path that
  adjusts probe directions and step sizes near bounds, including fixed
  coordinates and narrow intervals. Forwarding bounds alone does not keep
  the current probes feasible. Cover gradients and Jacobians first, with
  tests for objectives defined only inside their bounds.
- [x] **Add gradient and Jacobian checkers.** Compare analytic derivatives with
  finite differences using scale-aware error reports and optional
  directional checks. Reuse the bound-aware probe machinery when bounds are
  supplied, and distinguish non-finite evaluations from derivative
  mismatches.
- [ ] **Add robust nonlinear least squares.** Support Huber, soft-L1, Cauchy,
  and arctangent losses with a residual scale. Keep the reported objective,
  gradient, local model, and convergence tests consistent with the chosen
  loss. Compare outlier-contaminated fits with [SciPy's least-squares
  API](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.least_squares.html).
- [x] **Add full trust-region-reflective least squares.** Added
  `TrustRegionReflective` with Coleman-Li scaling, an explicit radius,
  reflected-step selection, a rank-aware dense SVD solve, and
  fixed-coordinate elimination. All four dense backends support `f32` and
  `f64`; active bounds and rank deficiency are covered by analytic and SciPy
  1.16.2 comparisons. `Trf` retains its existing bounded-LM behavior through
  Basin 1.x. The large-scale path remains a follow-up below.
- [ ] **Implement nonlinear conjugate gradient.** Add a low-memory first-order
  solver using the existing line-search interfaces. Choose a
  research-grounded update and restart policy, and test descent safeguards
  and ill-conditioned problems. Distinguish this from the linear CG used
  inside Steihaug's trust-region subproblem solver.
- [ ] **Implement DIRECT.** Add deterministic global optimization over finite
  box bounds, with documented subdivision and rectangle-selection rules.
  Compare solution quality and evaluation counts with [SciPy
  DIRECT](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.direct.html)
  on low- and moderate-dimensional multimodal problems.

### Follow-up candidates

- [ ] **Add iterative sparse least squares and Jacobian coloring.** Extend the
  full TRF work with Jacobian and transpose-Jacobian products, an LSMR
  solve, and the two-dimensional subspace method. Add sparsity-pattern-based
  finite-difference coloring to reduce residual evaluations. Existing sparse
  storage and direct solves do not provide this large-scale algorithm.
- [ ] **Expand differential evolution.** Prioritize additional mutation and
  crossover strategies and generation-wise mutation dithering beyond the
  current `DE/rand/1/bin`. Then assess supplied populations, Latin hypercube
  or low-discrepancy initialization, nonlinear constraint handling, and
  integer variables. Preserve seeded reproducibility and compose with the
  existing local-search facilities. See [SciPy differential
  evolution](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.differential_evolution.html).
- [ ] **Add dedicated linear least-squares solvers.** Implement nonnegative
  least squares and general box-bounded linear least squares. Reuse suitable
  factorizations and test rank deficiency, active bounds, and optimality
  against analytic solutions and [SciPy bounded linear least
  squares](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.lsq_linear.html).
- [ ] **Add curve-fitting helpers.** Provide residual construction, weighting or
  whitening, and optional local covariance estimates around existing
  least-squares solvers. Document the approximation and behavior under rank
  deficiency, active bounds, and robust losses. Use [SciPy
  curve_fit](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html)
  as a comparison for convenience and reporting.
- [x] **Expand scalar roots and bracketing.** Added automatic root and minimum
  bracketing, safeguarded secant, Newton, and Halley methods, and TOMS 748
  (`k = 2`). Root solvers retain direct fallible callbacks, signed function
  values, and bracket-based convergence. Bracketing is an explicit first
  stage.
- [ ] **Add batched independent scalar solves when a consumer needs them.**
  Build on the direct scalar root and bracketing APIs, preserving separate
  root and minimization convergence semantics. See [elementwise
  optimization](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.elementwise.html).
- [ ] **Add multivariate root solving when an integration needs it.** Start with
  a safeguarded Newton/hybrid method or Broyden, then assess Anderson
  acceleration and Newton-Krylov. Require residual-based root validation:
  convergence of a least-squares objective can leave a nonzero residual.
  Promote this work if a downstream consumer needs it, including access to
  the final Jacobian for sensitivities. See [SciPy nonlinear
  roots](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.root.html).
- [ ] **Evaluate COBYQA.** Add a quadratic-model method for nonlinear
  constraints if benchmarks justify it alongside COBYLA, BOBYQA, and LINCOA.
  Those existing methods cover different model or constraint classes.

### Longer-term candidates

- [ ] **Evaluate a trust-constr-style solver.** After SLSQP establishes
  constraint derivatives and native nonlinear equalities, assess a general
  constrained trust-region method with sparse derivatives, suitable
  factorizations, and feasibility and stationarity diagnostics. This is a
  larger project than the current barrier and augmented-Lagrangian adapters.
- [ ] **Assess remaining local methods.** Consider Powell's direction-set
  method, line-search Newton-CG, TNC, GLTR/`trust-krylov`, and SR1 Hessian
  updates when a workload demonstrates value. Powell's direction-set method
  is distinct from NEWUOA and BOBYQA; GLTR is distinct from Steihaug CG.
  Compare against [SciPy's local
  methods](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html).
- [ ] **Evaluate dogbox after strengthening TRF.** Add rectangular trust-region
  least squares if small bounded fitting problems benefit.
- [ ] **Assess complex-step differentiation.** Design an opt-in callback and
  scalar interface for complex perturbations without broadening every real
  solver's requirements. Document the analyticity requirement and operations
  that invalidate the approximation.
- [ ] **Evaluate SHGO and dual annealing after DIRECT.** Require evidence of
  useful coverage beyond the existing global methods. Treat dual annealing
  as a distinct algorithm from the current simulated annealing solver.
- [ ] **Defer LP/MILP, assignment, and isotonic regression.** Revisit these
  separate problem families only with concrete downstream demand. Assess
  optional integrations before expanding the core or adding heavy solver
  dependencies, preserving the default pure-Rust WASM build.

## General design

### State API additions for Basin 1.x

Ship these in order, preserving existing public APIs and behavior:

- [x] **Add owned checkpoint and result extraction.** Add a consuming
  `Stepper::into_checkpoint()` using `ExactCheckpoint`, then an opt-in run
  method returning the final solver, state, counts, and termination reason.
  Require neither `Clone` nor serialization.
- [x] **Introduce shared progress storage.** Start with point and first-order
  states for external and new solvers. Keep existing solver/state types,
  constructors, associated types, and serialized representations compatible.
- [x] **Add opt-in state capabilities.** Use new interfaces for checked record
  access, raw evaluation counts, and explicit incumbent-selection semantics.
  Bind new controls to the capabilities they need; preserve existing readers
  and stopping behavior.

### State API prototype

- [x] **Prototype shared progress states with solver-owned machinery.** Follow
  the [state and lifecycle
  contracts](CONTRIBUTING.md#state-and-lifecycle-contracts). Exercise BFGS
  and L-BFGS for ownership and backend inference, Nelder-Mead for
  observation, and simulated annealing for continuation. Preserve Basin 1.x
  public APIs and behavior while evaluating compatible additions.

#### Acceptance checks

Covered by the [executable prototype](crates/basin/tests/state_api_prototype.rs)
and its test-only support modules:

- [x] An external test solver updates shared first-order storage through public
  methods and obtains correct executor bookkeeping without custom state
  code.
- [x] Checked access distinguishes a seed, an evaluated rejected point, and an
  incumbent. Missing gradients cannot silently disable an attached check.
  Invalid structural updates preserve the previous record. Solver-owned
  memory capacity and explicit scale/simplex inputs have one construction
  path.
- [x] Nonmonotone iterations and complete population replacement preserve
  matching historical point/cost records. Equal costs retain metadata; NaN
  and positive infinity cannot poison incumbent selection; negative infinity
  does not establish unboundedness. CMA-ES considers mean and samples.
  Selection changes are explicit events, not inferred from iteration
  numbers.
- [x] A constrained transition to a higher-cost feasible incumbent preserves the
  solver's selection. Cost-only controls cannot treat an infeasible
  incumbent as a successful objective target.
- [x] Scalar, fused, batch, nested, and failing evaluations preserve raw counts.
  Mid-step publication stamps the final charged count without adding an
  iteration. Repeated boundary observation does not refresh incumbent age.
  Batches charge submitted work even on failure; fused calls charge each
  category. Shared-wrapper inner runs use deltas, and adapter counts merge
  once.
- [x] Reusing a solver for a fresh run agrees with fresh construction, including
  after a dimension change. Point warm starts reevaluate the point and reset
  momentum, model history, and convergence history. Independent chains use
  explicit seeds without consuming a prototype's live RNG.
- [x] Pausing and resuming BFGS/L-BFGS and deterministic seeded annealing
  reproduces uninterrupted evaluations and iterates, including
  iteration-zero checkpoints and stateful convergence checks. Hard errors do
  not publish partial state.
- [x] Nelder-Mead observation uses authoritative simplex storage without a
  second full copy. Final model access and checkpoint extraction consume
  ownership without imposing `Clone` or serialization on the solver.
- [x] Construction and the selected capability bounds work on every claimed
  backend, preserve `f32` round trips and the default WASM build, and keep
  matrix inference practical at ordinary BFGS call sites.

#### Findings and remaining design work

The ownership split works across the four backends and both scalar types. BFGS
infers its matrix through a backend association and accepts an explicit
override. Existing observers borrow the shared simplex, and owned checkpoints
preserve model, RNG, neighbor, and convergence history. Population updates
preserve member order so solver-owned per-member data stays aligned.

Before adding production APIs, settle the public home of the matrix association
and rank-update capability (currently a test-local adapter), factories for
resetting configured components, and integration with execution controls. The
algorithm adapters cover unbounded L-BFGS, classical Nelder-Mead, and annealing
without reannealing; serialization and performance remain migration work. Run
the prototype with `cargo test -p basin --test state_api_prototype` and the
desired backend features.

## Performance investigations

## Basin 2.0

- [ ] **Migrate existing solvers to shared progress states.** Build on the
  validated [prototype](#state-api-prototype) and [1.x
  additions](#state-api-additions-for-basin-1x). Replace legacy public
  solver/state types and apply uniform evaluation categories and the
  accepted initialization and continuation contracts. Document replacement
  constructors, public types, trait bounds, stopping semantics, and
  serialized-format compatibility.

- [ ] **Simplify and strengthen the full-form constraint API (tenet 4).**
  Consider having COBYLA consume `NonlinearConstraints` directly, removing
  the need for the `FoldedConstraints` compatibility adapter. Separate the
  constraint-value representation from `Param`, and avoid requiring an
  unused matrix type when linear blocks are absent. Define strict validation
  for NaN bounds, wrong-sign infinities, inverted bounds, and malformed
  shapes, with typed configuration errors that preserve user callback
  errors. Revisit problem typing if unconstrained solvers must reject
  constrained problems: a `CostFunction` bound alone cannot enforce that
  guarantee. Keep constraints problem-side, preserve distinct blocks, and
  require only the math capabilities each solver needs. Define migration
  from the 1.x API.

- [ ] Remove the deprecated `TerminationCriterion` facility, all shipped
  criterion types and re-exports, `Executor::terminate_on`,
  `InnerExecutor::terminate_on`, composed `inner_terminate_on` methods,
  `run_loop`, and `ResumableInner::segment_criteria`. Retain stopping
  reasons, solver convergence setters, direct execution controls, and
  closure hooks.

- [ ] Remove deprecated tolerance and algorithm-setting aliases, including
  scalar/root and line-search aliases.

- [ ] Remove `BarrierMethod::new`, `AugmentedLagrangianMethod::new`, and
  `with_inner_grad_tol`, along with their implicit inner-gradient checks.
  Use `with_inner_solver` and the supplied solver's convergence settings.

- [ ] Move remaining shared numerical calculations out of the compatibility
  criterion types and remove the compatibility-only tests and bridges.

- [ ] **Make the `problems` feature opt-in.** Set `default = []` while retaining
  `problems = []` for benchmarks, examples, and other corpus consumers. Keep
  the existing default through Basin 1.x: removing it breaks downstream
  imports that rely on implicit activation. Update documentation and ensure
  tests, examples, benchmarks, and the WASM visualizer explicitly enable
  `problems` wherever they use the corpus.

- [ ] **Reconsider exact evaluation budgets for Basin 2.0.** In Basin 1.x,
  `max_cost_evals` remains a boundary-checked execution limit:
  `Solver::init` and an active `Solver::next_iter` finish before the
  executor checks it, so initialization and batched iterations may exceed
  the threshold. A future hard-cap API would need executor/problem-level
  control flow that prevents callbacks after exhaustion, handles batch
  reservation and composed problems, and defines the outcome when the budget
  cannot complete initialization. Cover COBYLA's `n + 1`-point
  initialization and zero-to-two-evaluation steps in any resulting contract
  and tests.

## Deferred design

- [ ] **Revisit a shared constraint-violation capability (tenet 3).** COBYLA and
  constrained MADS now provide multiple consumers, but they use different
  violation measures, and only `ConstrainedMadsState` exposes its measure.
  Define common state semantics before adding a reporting API or a composite
  feasibility-and-optimality stopping rule. Do not add a standalone
  `FeasibilityTolerance`: executor criteria are combined with OR, so it
  could stop at the first feasible but nonoptimal iterate.

- [ ] **Design nonlinear equality constraints when a solver needs their
  structure (tenet 4).** Coordinate with the [SLSQP
  task](#priority-additions), which supplies that consumer. Existing
  derivative-free paths can represent `g(x) = 0` as the pair `g(x) ≤ 0` and
  `−g(x) ≤ 0`; the native interface must validate equality-specific
  operations and semantics with SLSQP.
